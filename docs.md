# Flow Desktop Documentation

## Introduction

Flow Desktop is a modern, lightweight desktop environment designed for Linux systems. Built with performance and simplicity in mind, Flow Desktop emphasizes minimal resource consumption while delivering a highly customizable user interface. Its core components rely on XCB for X11 interactions and GTK4 for building and managing the settings user interface. Seamlessly integrating with the Openbox window manager, Flow Desktop provides a clean, minimal aesthetic that does not compromise on functionality. Whether you are a developer seeking a platform that adapts to low-resource environments or a user who appreciates a uncluttered desktop experience, Flow Desktop offers a robust solution with ample opportunities for customization and extension.

This documentation explains the architecture and design decisions behind Flow Desktop, provides a thorough overview of its code structure, and guides you through building, installing, and contributing to the project. The repository is licensed under GPL v3.0, ensuring that Flow Desktop remains free and open for all who wish to improve it.

## Project Architecture

Flow Desktop is structured with modularity in mind. This design philosophy allows for clear separation between its components while supporting easy maintenance and further development. The primary pillars of the system include:

1. **XCB for X11 Integration:**  
   XCB (X protocol C-language Binding) is used as the primary interface to communicate with the X11 system. By leveraging XCB, Flow Desktop achieves direct access to the low‑level X server calls, which contributes to its efficiency and performance. The use of XCB ensures that the desktop environment can fully support traditional X11 applications while preparing for smooth integration with modern display protocols.

2. **GTK4-Powered Settings and Tools:**  
   The settings panel, along with developer tools and auxiliary utilities, is built using GTK4. This modern toolkit not only ensures a sleek and responsive interface but also makes it easier for developers to create extensions or modifications. GTK4’s support for theming, animations, and accessibility features plays a crucial role in Flow Desktop’s user experience.

3. **Openbox Integration:**  
   Openbox is known for its minimalistic approach to window management. Flow Desktop leverages Openbox as the underlying window manager, ensuring that window decorations and management remain lightweight while providing sufficient customizability through user configurations. The integration allows for both seamless desktop interactions and minimal overhead, making it ideal for users with older hardware or those who prefer a stripped‑down environment.

4. **Modular Components:**  
   The project is divided into several key executables:  
   - **Flow:** The main desktop interface that handles taskbars, application menus, and basic window management.
   - **Flow‑Settings:** A configuration tool that lets users adjust system settings, change wallpapers, and customize the UI.
   - **Flow‑Builder:** A development tool that integrates a code editor with terminal functionalities, tailored toward developers who wish to extend or troubleshoot the desktop environment.

By decoupling these components, the project remains clean and extensible. Each part can be developed or debugged independently, enabling rapid integration of new features.

## Code Structure

The repository for Flow Desktop is organized in a clear, modular fashion. While different branches or directories may evolve over time, here is an overview of the current layout:

- **/flow:**  
  This directory contains the core source code for the desktop interface. It is where the XCB interactions occur, managing the creation and control of the desktop, handling user inputs, and interfacing with Openbox. The code here emphasizes efficiency – using lightweight data structures and minimal dependencies to ensure rapid performance.

- **/flow-settings:**  
  In this folder, you will find the source code for the settings interface, built with GTK4. This section is responsible for user-configurable options, theming, and system information display. The use of GTK4 allows for modern user experience elements such as animations, smooth transitions, and responsive design.

- **/flow-builder:**  
  This component is targeted at developers who want to work on creating extensions or monitoring their system. You’ll notice that it integrates a code editor with a terminal, offering a powerful development environment in the comfort of your desktop interface.

- **/docs (or Documentation files):**  
  Documentation resources, guidelines, and design rationales can be located in this section. It provides insights into coding conventions, the build process, and future enhancements. Although not all repositories come with an elaborate /docs folder, Flow Desktop benefits from detailed inline comments and documentation files that help new contributors understand the project’s architecture.

- **/build (or Build Scripts):**  
  Build configuration files and scripts (typically for Meson and Ninja) reside here. These scripts automate the compilation process, ensuring that dependencies are handled efficiently. The use of Meson simplifies configuration, while Ninja accelerates the build process.

The code is annotated with verbose comments where necessary. Developers are encouraged to follow coding conventions that prioritize clarity, modularity, and maintainability. With separation of concerns being a primary goal, contributions that alter one component are designed to minimize cross‑module dependencies.

## Build and Installation Instructions

Building flow desktop is straightforward, thanks to the use of modern build tools. Follow these steps to get Flow Desktop up and running on your Linux machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superuser-pushexe/Flow-Desktop.git
   ```

2. **Setup the Build Directory:**  
   It’s best practice to create an out‑of‑source build to keep your working directory clean:

   ```bash
   cd Flow-Desktop
   mkdir build && cd build
   meson setup ..
   ```

3. **Compile the Project:**  
   Once the build setup is complete, compile the project using Ninja:

   ```bash
   ninja
   ```

4. **Launch the Desktop Components:**  
   After a successful build, start the components using a command such as:

   ```bash
   startx ./flow ./flow-settings ./flow-builder
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that Openbox is running before launching Flow Desktop. You might need to adjust your `~/.xinitrc` or session start-up files to work with Openbox.

Dependencies include the standard Linux system libraries for XCB, GTK4, and other related libraries. Detailed dependency information is available in the repository’s README or within the documentation files.

## Contribution Guidelines
